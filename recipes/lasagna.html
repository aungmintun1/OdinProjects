    <h3>The Best Homemade Lasagna</h3>

    <p>  
        Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? 
        It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck.<br>
         It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.
        Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover<br>
         sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days.
        Alton's original recipe<br>
         created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <h2>For the meat sauce</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li> <br>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li> <br>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li> <br>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li> <br>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li> <br>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li> <br>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li> <br>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li> <br>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li> <br>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li> <br>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li> <br>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li> <br>
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li> <br>
        <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li> <br>
        <li>Salt</li> <br>
         
    </ul>

    <h2>To assemble the lasagna</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li> <br>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li> <br>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li> <br>
        <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li> <br>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, 
        tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li> <br>

        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded 
        mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
        </li><br>

        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a
        layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
        </li><br>
        
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li> <br>
    </ol>
